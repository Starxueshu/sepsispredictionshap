It is important to establish venous access as soon as possible for high-risk sepsis patients, although peripheral venous access may meet the needs of some patients during initial resuscitation, central venous access is required for most patients during treatment for the administration of intravenous fluids, medications, blood products, and frequent laboratory testing. Specific recommendations for identifying the focus of sepsis and controlling the source of infection, as well as early administration of antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, are provided. In addition, healthcare institutions should strictly adhere to trauma patient management protocols and infection control protocols to prevent early exacerbation of immune suppression and increased susceptibility to infection in the initial stages after trauma, and to minimize the risk of healthcare-associated infections that may lead to sepsis.")

The AI application was developed using the eXGBM model, with a prediction performance of 0.912 (AUC). This tool may empower healthcare professionals to make more accurate and timely decisions, ultimately reducing the sepsis rates and improving patient outcomes.')
